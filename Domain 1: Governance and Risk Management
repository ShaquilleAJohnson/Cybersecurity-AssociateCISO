Governance and Risk Management

Domain 1: Governance and Risk Management

	1.	Security Monitoring: Techniques and Tools for Continuous Monitoring of Security Events and Logs
	•	Implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions such as Splunk or ELK Stack.
	•	Configure and deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) like Snort and Suricata.
	•	Use log management tools such as Graylog or Fluentd for centralized log collection and analysis.
	•	Develop and deploy custom scripts for log parsing and anomaly detection.
	2.	Incident Response: Frameworks and Automation for Effective Incident Response
	•	Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures.
	•	Implement automated incident response platforms like Cortex XSOAR or Splunk Phantom.
	•	Conduct regular incident response drills and simulations to test readiness.
	•	Use playbooks for common incident types to ensure standardized responses.
	3.	Threat Intelligence: Integration and Utilization of Threat Intelligence Feeds to Anticipate and Mitigate Potential Threats
	•	Subscribe to multiple threat intelligence feeds such as AlienVault OTX, ThreatConnect, or Recorded Future.
	•	Integrate threat intelligence feeds into the SIEM for real-time correlation and alerting.

	4.	Vulnerability Management: Best Practices for Identifying, Assessing, and Mitigating Vulnerabilities in IT Systems
	•	Implement vulnerability scanning tools such as Nessus, Qualys, or OpenVAS.
	•	Develop a vulnerability management policy that includes regular scans and timely remediation.
	•	Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact, using CVSS scores.
	•	Automate patch management processes to ensure timely application of security updates.
	5.	Automation and Orchestration: Implementing Automation to Streamline Security Operations and Reduce Response Times
	•	Use security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms to automate repetitive tasks.

	•	Continuously monitor and optimize automation processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Python Scripts

1. Security Monitoring: Log Parsing and Anomaly Detection

import re

def parse_logs(log_file):
    parsed_logs = []
    with open(log_file, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Example regex for parsing logs
            match = re.match(r'(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) (\w+) (.+)', line)
            if match:
                parsed_logs.append({
                    'timestamp': match.group(1),
                    'log_level': match.group(2),
                    'message': match.group(3)
                })
    return parsed_logs

def detect_anomalies(parsed_logs):
    anomalies = []
    for log in parsed_logs:
        # Example rule: flag errors as anomalies
        if log['log_level'] == 'ERROR':
            anomalies.append(log)
    return anomalies

log_file = 'system.log'
parsed_logs = parse_logs(log_file)
anomalies = detect_anomalies(parsed_logs)

for anomaly in anomalies:
    print(f"Anomaly detected: {anomaly['timestamp']} - {anomaly['message']}")

2. Incident Response: Automated Incident Handling

import requests

def send_alert(message):
    webhook_url = 'https://your-webhook-url.com'
    data = {'text': message}
    requests.post(webhook_url, json=data)

def handle_incident(incident):
    incident_id = incident['id']
    incident_type = incident['type']
    if incident_type == 'malware':
        # Example automation: isolate infected system
        isolate_system(incident['system_id'])
        send_alert(f"Malware incident detected: {incident_id}, system isolated.")
    elif incident_type == 'data_breach':
        # Example automation: initiate data breach protocol
        initiate_data_breach_protocol(incident['details'])
        send_alert(f"Data breach incident detected: {incident_id}, protocol initiated.")
    
def isolate_system(system_id):
    # Code to isolate system (e.g., disable network interface)
    pass

def initiate_data_breach_protocol(details):
    # Code to initiate data breach protocol
    pass

incident = {'id': '1234', 'type': 'malware', 'system_id': 'server01', 'details': '...'}
handle_incident(incident)

3. Threat Intelligence: Ingest and Normalize Threat Data

import requests
import json

def fetch_threat_intel(feed_url):
    response = requests.get(feed_url)
    return response.json()

def normalize_threat_data(threat_data):
    normalized_data = []
    for threat in threat_data:
        normalized_data.append({
            'threat_id': threat['id'],
            'threat_type': threat['type'],
            'severity': threat['severity'],
            'description': threat['description'],
            'timestamp': threat['timestamp']
        })
    return normalized_data

feed_url = 'https://threat-intel-feed-url.com'
threat_data = fetch_threat_intel(feed_url)
normalized_data = normalize_threat_data(threat_data)

with open('normalized_threat_data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(normalized_data, file, indent=4)

4. Vulnerability Management: Automating Patch Management

import subprocess

def scan_vulnerabilities():
    # Example command to run vulnerability scan using OpenVAS
    result = subprocess.run(['openvas', '--scan', '--target', '192.168.1.0/24'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

def parse_vulnerabilities(scan_output):
    vulnerabilities = []
    for line in scan_output.split('\n'):
        if 'Vulnerability found' in line:
            vulnerabilities.append(line)
    return vulnerabilities

def apply_patches(vulnerabilities):
    for vuln in vulnerabilities:
        # Example automation: apply patches based on vulnerability description
        if 'Critical' in vuln:
            subprocess.run(['apt-get', 'update'])
            subprocess.run(['apt-get', 'upgrade', '-y'])
            print(f"Applied patches for vulnerability: {vuln}")

scan_output = scan_vulnerabilities()
vulnerabilities = parse_vulnerabilities(scan_output)
apply_patches(vulnerabilities)

5. Automation and Orchestration: Automated Workflows for Threat Hunting

import requests

def fetch_logs():
    # Example function to fetch logs from a log management system
    response = requests.get('https://log-management-system-url.com/logs')
    return response.json()

def analyze_logs(logs):
    threats = []
    for log in logs:
        # Example rule: detect suspicious activity
        if 'suspicious' in log['message']:
            threats.append(log)
    return threats

def respond_to_threats(threats):
    for threat in threats:
        # Example automation: send alert and isolate system
        send_alert(f"Suspicious activity detected: {threat['timestamp']} - {threat['message']}")
        isolate_system(threat['system_id'])

logs = fetch_logs()
threats = analyze_logs(logs)
respond_to_threats(threats)
