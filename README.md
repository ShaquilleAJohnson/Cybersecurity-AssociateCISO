2. **Cryptography**: Implementation and management of encryption technologies.
3. **Network Security**: Protecting network infrastructure from threats.

### Domain 5: Strategic Plan
1. **Long-term Planning**: Developing a strategic vision for cybersecurity.
2. **Innovation**: Exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance security.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and mitigating long-term security risks.

## Key Learnings

- **Importance of Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and analysis of security events are crucial for early detection and mitigation of threats.
- **Incident Response Planning**: Having a well-defined and practiced incident response plan significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of handling security incidents.
- **Leveraging Threat Intelligence**: Incorporating threat intelligence into security operations helps in proactively identifying and mitigating potential threats.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks and integrating various security tools can enhance operational efficiency and reduce human error.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular vulnerability assessments and timely patching are essential to maintaining a secure IT environment.

## Sample Python Code

Below is a sample Python script used in the research for automating log analysis. This script parses security logs and identifies potential threats based on predefined rules.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load log data
logs = pd.read_csv('security_logs.csv')

# Define suspicious activity rules
def is_suspicious(log):
    if 'failed login' in log['message']:
        return True
    if 'unauthorized access' in log['message']:
        return True
    return False

# Apply rules to identify suspicious logs
logs['suspicious'] = logs.apply(is_suspicious, axis=1)

# Filter suspicious logs
suspicious_logs = logs[logs['suspicious']]

# Save suspicious logs to a file
suspicious_logs.to_csv('suspicious_logs.csv', index=False)

print(f'Total suspicious logs found: {len(suspicious_logs)}')
```
