Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Enterprise Security System Architecture and Management practices, covering key domains of governance and risk management. It details the systems, tools, and architectures used for effective security monitoring, incident response, threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and automation.

Components

Security Monitoring

	•	Techniques and Tools for Continuous Monitoring of Security Events and Logs
	•	System: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
	•	Tools: Splunk, LogRhythm, IBM QRadar, SolarWinds Security Event Manager
	•	Architecture: Centralized log collection, integration with EDR, real-time alerting, and visualization.

Incident Response

	•	Frameworks and Automation for Effective Incident Response
	•	System: Incident Response Platform (IRP)
	•	Tools: IBM Resilient, Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR, ServiceNow Security Incident Response
	•	Architecture: Incident detection, automated playbooks, integration with SIEM and threat intelligence, post-incident analysis.

Threat Intelligence

	•	Integration and Utilization of Threat Intelligence Feeds to Anticipate and Mitigate Potential Threats
	•	System: Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
	•	Tools: ThreatConnect, Recorded Future, Anomali, ThreatQuotient
	•	Architecture: Aggregation of threat feeds, correlation with internal data, automated threat scoring, real-time SIEM and IRP integration.

Vulnerability Management

	•	Best Practices for Identifying, Assessing, and Mitigating Vulnerabilities in IT Systems
	•	System: Vulnerability Management System (VMS)
	•	Tools: Qualys, Tenable Nessus, Rapid7 InsightVM
	•	Architecture: Automated network scanning, vulnerability prioritization, integration with patch management, reporting and remediation tracking.

Automation and Orchestration

	•	Implementing Automation to Streamline Security Operations and Reduce Response Times
	•	System: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
	•	Tools: Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR, Splunk Phantom, IBM Resilient
	•	Architecture: Automated incident response workflows, integration with SIEM, IRP, and VMS, real-time data enrichment, automated remediation.

System Components and Their Roles

	1.	User Devices
	•	Monitored by EDR solutions to detect malicious activities
	2.	Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
	•	Continuously monitors and analyzes endpoint activities to detect threats
	3.	Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
	•	Aggregates log data, analyzes security events, provides real-time monitoring
	4.	Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
	•	Aggregates and processes threat intelligence feeds for enhanced detection
	5.	Incident Response Platform (IRP)
	•	Manages and automates incident response processes with workflows and playbooks
	6.	Vulnerability Management System (VMS)
	•	Scans for vulnerabilities, prioritizes risks, tracks remediation efforts
	7.	Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
	•	Automates security operations, integrates with SIEM, IRP, and TIP

Deployment and Monitoring

	•	Deployment: On-premises, cloud, or hybrid environments with scalable architecture
	•	Monitoring: 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) for continuous monitoring, automated alerts, and manual investigations
